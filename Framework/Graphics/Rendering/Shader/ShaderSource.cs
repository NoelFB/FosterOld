/// TODO: This isn't api-agnostic and doesn't represent the final implementation
/// 
/// Not sure what the best way to implement this is:
/// 
///     1)  Create our own Shader language that each platform can convert
///         into their required language. This has a lot of drawbacks
///         because it needs to be very easy to parse somehow ...
///         
///     2)  Require either GLSL or HLSL and use a 3rd party tool to convert them.
///         The problem here is that I don't want to add more dependencies (especially
///         since most of these tools are offline / not in C#). I would like everything to
///         be cross-platform and runtime available.
///         
///     3)  Don't worry about it and just make the end-user write shaders for each platform
///         they intend to use, and load them manually. (** what currently happens **)
